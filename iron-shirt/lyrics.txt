(Verse 1)
In this digital domain, where algorithms reign,
Lines of code like chains, dictating every strain,
With our iPhones in command, Androids at our hand,
We're fluent in the languages of this virtual land.

(Chorus)
But underneath this iron shirt, lies a world that's getting hurt,
Globalization's grip, capitalism's thirst,
We're dancing to the beat, while the world's on repeat,
In this modern paradox, where the truth's discreet.

(Verse 2)
Big Pharma's data mined, selling cures for every bind,
From the servers to the screen, they've got us all confined,
But there's a rhythm in dissent, a pulse beneath the code,
Reggae's timeless voice, saying "Break the mold".

(Chorus)
Underneath this iron shirt, lies a world that's getting hurt,
Globalization's grip, capitalism's thirst,
We're dancing to the beat, while the world's on repeat,
In this modern paradox, where the truth's discreet.

(Bridge)
So let's reboot the system, hack into the scheme,
Find our roots in the real, where the rivers gleam,
For in unity and code, we'll script a new scene,
Where humanity's the algorithm, love the main theme.

(Chorus)
Underneath this iron shirt, lies a world that's getting hurt,
Globalization's grip, capitalism's thirst,
We're dancing to the beat, while the world's on repeat,
In this modern paradox, where the truth's discreet.

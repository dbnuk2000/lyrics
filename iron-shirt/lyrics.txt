(Verse 1)
In this digital age, where screens dictate our days,
Lost in a virtual haze, chasing pixels in a craze,
Got our iPhones in hand, Androids in demand,
Tablets and gadgets, we're living in command.

(Chorus)
But underneath this iron shirt, lies a world that's getting hurt,
Globalization's grip, capitalism's thirst,
We're dancing to the beat, while the world's on repeat,
In this modern paradox, where the truth's discreet.

(Verse 2)
Big Pharma's got a hold, selling pills for every woe,
From the cradle to the grave, they've got us in their fold,
But there's a rhythm in the streets, a rebellion in the air,
Reggae's beating heart, saying it's time to care.

(Chorus)
Underneath this iron shirt, lies a world that's getting hurt,
Globalization's grip, capitalism's thirst,
We're dancing to the beat, while the world's on repeat,
In this modern paradox, where the truth's discreet.

(Bridge)
So let's break free from the chains of the corporate game,
Find our roots in the soil, let our souls reclaim,
For in unity and love, we'll find the power to change,
To rewrite the story, to a melody so strange.

(Chorus)
Underneath this iron shirt, lies a world that's getting hurt,
Globalization's grip, capitalism's thirst,
We're dancing to the beat, while the world's on repeat,
In this modern paradox, where the truth's discreet.
